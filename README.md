# spotify-recommender
In this repository I seek to implement a recommendation algorithm using nonnegative matrix factorization. I try this out on a simple grocery store example to ensure that it works. I then apply SKLearn's NMF implementation to a music streaming dataset to recreate Spotify's algorithm for creating the "Discovery Weekly" playlist for a given user.
